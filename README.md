# Guess-The-Number

Guess The Number is a simple web-based game, which has random number (which is hidden) and user has to guess it .
The game is made in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Some of the highlights of game are:
 - Generates Random Number, everytime user plays.
 - Score is decreased for wrong attempt everytime. and if score is "zero" the user loses the game.
 - Added play again button, so that user can play again without refreshing the browser.
 - Added Highscore Section, so that everytime you have a highscore than your previous score, then the highscore section is updated.

 That's it, Enjoy and Thankyou.....!
